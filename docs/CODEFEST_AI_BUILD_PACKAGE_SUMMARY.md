## QUICK REFERENCE — KEY DECISIONS

### One-Line Pitch
"Hackathon projects shouldn't die. Codefest.ai keeps them alive."

### Core Value Props
1. **For Students**: Level playing field. Curated resources. No wasted first hour.
2. **For Teams**: Live collaboration, role clarity, project planning in one place.
3. **For Projects**: Don't die after demo day. Become learning repository.
4. **For Communities**: Actually receive the tools built "for" them.
5. **For Schools**: Enterprise oversight, judging, analytics.
6. **For Sponsors**: Real engagement data, not just logo placement.

### 6-Layer Architecture
1. **Resource Layer** — Library, Docs, Winners, Search
2. **Team Layer** — Profiles, Formation, Roles, Comms
3. **Project Layer** — Planning, Kanban, GitHub, Whiteboard
4. **Live Competition Layer** — Clock-in, Global dashboard, Real-time progress
5. **Preservation Layer** — Project hosting, Learning repo, Fork/improve
6. **Enterprise Layer** — School dashboards, Judging, Analytics, Billing

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Zustand
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes + Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Storage)
- **Integrations:** GitHub OAuth + API, Excalidraw, Claude API
- **Deploy:** Vercel

### 9 Build Phases
1. Foundation (Next.js, Supabase, Auth, Layout)
2. Component Library (seed data, grid, search, bookmarks)
3. Showcase/Winners (winning projects, "shop the look")
4. Teams & Profiles (creation, invites, roles)
5. Project Planning (kanban, component selection, whiteboard)
6. GitHub Integration (OAuth, repo linking, commits)
7. Live Competitions (listing, clock-in, dashboard)
8. Team Chat (real-time messaging)
9. AI Features (search, brainstorm, architecture suggest)

### Islamic Compliance
- ✅ Subscriptions, one-time payments, enterprise licensing, sponsorships, donations
- ❌ Interest-based financing, gambling mechanics, haram product sponsors

### Gradate Integration (Future)
Codefest.ai becomes entry point into Gradate ecosystem — demonstrates coordination infrastructure in action.

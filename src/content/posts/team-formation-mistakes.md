The hardest part of a hackathon isn't the code. It's the people.

I don't mean conflict or drama — most hackathon teams are collaborative and well-intentioned. The problem is structural: 24 hours is long enough for bad team dynamics to kill a project, but short enough that there's no time to fix them once they surface.

These are the five patterns I've seen most often.

## 1. The Missing Role Problem

Most hackathon teams assemble around shared enthusiasm — "we all love this idea" — without asking who's doing what. Then, 6 hours in, everyone's building backend and nobody's touched the frontend. Or there's a beautiful UI and no data underneath it.

**The fix:** Before you write a line of code, assign explicit ownership. Not job titles — specific deliverables.

- Who owns the landing page (what a judge sees at the demo)?
- Who owns the data model?
- Who's writing the pitch?
- Who's the external-facing communicator if an organizer has questions?

These don't need to be permanent assignments. They just need to exist so nothing falls between the cracks.

## 2. The Consensus Trap

Some teams try to make every decision together. This feels collaborative. It's actually a bottleneck.

In a 24-hour sprint, the cost of a decision is almost never the decision itself — it's the time spent reaching it. A slightly worse architecture decided in 2 minutes beats a slightly better one decided in 20.

**The fix:** Designate a technical lead who makes final calls on stack, structure, and implementation approach. Not a dictator — just a tiebreaker. Everyone else retains autonomy in their own domain.

## 3. The All-Builders Team

Teams of 5 engineers with no one designated to think about narrative and presentation consistently underperform teams with 3 engineers and one person focused on the demo.

Judges experience your project as a story, not a codebase. If no one's thinking about that story until hour 22, you're pitching cold.

**The fix:** Identify your pitch person early — someone who understands the problem deeply and can explain the solution clearly without code. They should be prepping the narrative in parallel with the build, not learning it at the last minute.

## 4. Silent Blockers

Someone's stuck. They've been stuck for two hours. They haven't said anything because they don't want to slow the team down.

This is extremely common, especially with less experienced developers. It's also completely preventable.

**The fix:** Establish a 15-minute rule: if you're stuck on something for 15 minutes without progress, you say it out loud. Not to be rescued — just to surface it. Sometimes the solution is obvious to someone else. Sometimes you just need to timebox it and move on.

## 5. The Scope Creep Start

The idea is good. Then it gets a little bigger. Then someone says "what if we also—" and suddenly you're building five products instead of one.

This happens fastest in the first two hours, when excitement is highest and reality hasn't set in yet.

**The fix:** Define your "demo path" before you start building. The demo path is the exact sequence of screens or interactions a judge will see in 3 minutes. Everything outside that path is post-hackathon. Write it down. Refer to it when scope creep starts.

## What the Codefest.ai Team Layer Does

The Teams feature in Codefest.ai is designed around these failure modes specifically. Role assignment is built into team setup — not as a formality, but as a forcing function. The kanban board for project tasks exists to make blockers visible before they become two-hour sinkholes.

None of this replaces good judgment. But structure reduces the cost of poor judgment at 3am.

The goal is the same as everything else here: eliminate friction between "clock starts" and "first commit."
